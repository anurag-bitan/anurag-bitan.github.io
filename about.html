            <span class="speech"> Hello and welcome to my portfolio website!

                I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate with nearly two years of professional experience as a Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Having recently concluded my journey at TCS, I’m now actively seeking new opportunities to grow and contribute in a dynamic tech environment.<br><br>

This is my first portfolio website — a space where I share my projects, technical skills, and the path I've taken so far. Throughout my career, I’ve maintained a proactive attitude, strong problem-solving skills, and a constant desire to learn and improve.<br><br>

With a "never give up" mindset, I’ve faced challenges head-on and believe that perseverance and curiosity are key to innovation. I’m passionate about building impactful solutions and continuously exploring new tools and technologies.<br><br>

Through this platform, I aim to connect with like-minded professionals and explore exciting new opportunities in the tech industry.<br>
